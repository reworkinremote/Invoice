Reimburse
=========


###Installation
* I hope this python script find you well ~

#How to use
*Edit your bills.txt to include all your bills amount as the following line.
```sh
138
125
469
150.2
999
149
169
185
177.6
358
149
329
74
179
```
*Assuming you have just installed python on your system.
```sh
python reimburse.py bills.txt 2550
```
parameter `2550` is your reimburse money.
At last, you will find your coconut.txt which gives you best choice to select bills.

###output
`2550.0 :        138.0   999.0   149.0   169.0   185.0   358.0   149.0   329.0   74.0`

This is my python script version attached as well, in case that's useful.
